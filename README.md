## General Information
- On the emergency of Covid pandemic A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- So based on the survey data a mathematical model has been determined to predict the count of shared bike on the basis of environmental condition, year, month, holiday etc.
